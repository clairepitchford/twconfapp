Feature: As an Attendee, I want the sessions to appear in order on the schedule list, so that schedule times are clear to me

	Scenario Outline: An earlier session should be before a later session
		Given I open the Schedule tab
		And open the <schedule_day> schedule
		Then I should see an <early_session> before a <later_session>
		
		Examples:
			| schedule_day	| early_session	| later_session |
			| Wednesday		| 10:00AM		| 10:15AM		|
			| Wednesday		| 03:20PM		| 04:25PM		|
			| Thursday		| 09:00AM		| 10:15AM		|
			# | Friday		| 09:00AM		| 01:00PM		|
			# | Friday		| 11:15AM		| 01:00PM		|

        <p>Corey Haines has spent much of his 13+year professional career in the Microsoft ecosystem, until moving out of the corporate world and joining a small startup doing Ruby on Rails. After leaving the startup in 2008, he began a year-long journey, traveling the midwest and east coast of the United States on a pair-programming tour. He would spend anywhere from a day to a week at different places, pairing with people in exchange for room and board. While on the road, he has also focused on expanding and defining the message of the Software Craftsmanship movement, as it pertains to both professionalism and career development.</p>
        <p>Corey has been practicing the Extreme Programming techniques for nearly 6 years; following the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) techniques since the first rumblings of it in 2005. Lately, he has been actively mentoring others in the BDD workflow, as it pertains to day-to-day engineering practices, such as test-driven design, executable acceptance criteria and 'outside-in' development.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, Corey travels to speak, study and facilitate Code Retreat events. During his travels, he is also collecting ideas for establishing a craftsmanship-based school of software development.</p>

        <p>Michael strives to raise the bar and ease the pain for developers across the country. He shares his passion and energy for improvement with everyone he meets, sometimes even with their permission. Michael has spent the better part of 20 years learning what it means to be a professional programmer who cares about art, quality, and craft. He's always ready to spend time with other developers who are fully engaged and devoted to their work--the "wide awake" developers. On the flip side, he cannot abide apathy or wasted potential.</p>
        <p>Michael has been a professional programmer and architect for nearly 20 years. During that time, he has delivered running systems to the U. S. Government, the military, banking, finance, agriculture, and retail industries. More often than not, Michael has lived with the systems he built. This experience with the real world of operations changed his views about software architecture and development forever.</p>
        <p>He worked through the birth and infancy of a Tier 1 retail site and has often served as "roving troubleshooter" for other online businesses. These experiences give him a unique perspective on building software for high performance and high reliability in the face of an actively hostile environment.</p>
        <p>Most recently, Michael wrote "Release It! Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software", a book that realizes many of his thoughts about building software that does more than just pass QA, it survives the real world. Michael previously wrote numerous articles and editorials, spoke at Comdex, and co-authored one of the early Java books.</p>

        <p>Creator of Spring</p> 
        <p>Author of "Expert One-on-One J2EE Development without EJB"</p>
        <p>GM SpringSource Division, VMware</p>
    description: |
        <p>Rod is SVP, Middleware and GM of the SpringSource division at VMware. He is a thought leader on open source, as well as a popular speaker at conferences and symposia around the world. Spring was based on the code published with Rod's best-selling Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development (2002). This book was one of the most influential books ever published on J2EE and the sequel, J2EE without EJB (July 2004, with Juergen Hoeller), has proven almost equally significant, establishing a comprehensive vision for lightweight, post-EJB J2EE development.</p>
        <p>Rod has specialized in server-side Java since 1996 across a wide range of industries. His hands-on experience has led him to see problems from a client's perspective as well as a technology perspective, and has driven his influential criticism of bloated, inefficient, orthodox approaches to J2EE architecture.</p>
        <p>Rod is a member of the Java Community Process (JCP) Executive Committee (EC). EC members guide the evolution of the Java technologies by approving and voting on all technology proposals. They are also responsible for defining the JCP's rules of governance and the legal agreement between members and the organization.</p>
        <p>Rod holds a BA with Honors in Computer Science, Mathematics and Musicology as well as a Phd from the University of Sydney.</p>
        <p>Rod is SVP, Middleware and GM of the SpringSource division at VMware.</p>

            <p>Bought the world's first Erlang licence</p>
            <p>Specialist in the Architecture and Design of Carrier-Class Telecom Systems</p>

        <p>Languages & Community</p>
        <p>Ulf Wiger became one of the first commercial users of Erlang (certainly the first in North America) when he bought a license in 1993. At the time, he was busy designing disaster response systems in Alaska. In 1996, he joined Ericsson and became Chief Designer of the AXD 301 development. At nearly 2 million lines of Erlang code, AXD 301 is the most complex system ever built in Erlang, and probably the most complex commercial system built in any functional language. In recent years, Ulf has been involved in several products based on the AXD 301 architecture, and has been an active member of the Open Source Erlang community. In February 2009, Ulf began his new job as CTO of Erlang Solutions Ltd.</p>
        <p>Senior Specialist in the Architecture and Design of carrier-class systems. Has had the rare opportunity to influence a world-class product from conception through product release, several years of feature upgrades and maintenance, and finally a significant technology shift. Previous experience includes architecture and design of decision support technology for the US DOD and the Alaska Integrated Incident Management System.. A special interest is trying to bridge the cultures of research, Open Source development, and industrial design.</p>
        <p>Software Passion: To expand my mind by meeting people from all walks of life. Hopefully, their minds will do a bit of expanding too...</p>
